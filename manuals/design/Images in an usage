##Images in an usage

All images should be in a good quality. First tip is a upload an image in a **2x size**. 
Please remember to create an image in a 2x size. For example if you want to upload an image with a frame size 1200*800 you should prepare an image with a size 2400*1600

The main goal is to find theÂ balance between the lowest file size and an acceptable quality. You should upload a medium compression (high quality) photos at our websites.
