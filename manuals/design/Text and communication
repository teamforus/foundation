# Text and communication

## Solving the user's problem
A person uses the interface to solve a specific task or problem. We write the text so that it helps to solve this problem here and now. If the text doesn't do this or solves another problem, we don't use it.

## We speak the user's language
The interface must speak the same language as the person is speaking. We create products for a wide audience, so the interface language should be universal and understandable for everyone.

## Not overload
Homogeneous sentence members, complex syntax, and redundant information overload the text. When it is difficult to understand, it does not help the user to solve the problem. To avoid this, we write briefly, simply, and to the point.

## We observe uniformity
In all interfaces, we make texts uniform in structure, design, and vocabulary. Uniformity helps a person to quickly navigate the familiar interface and not get confused in the new one.

## Voice of interface
In order for a sentence to be strong, voluminous, and concise, it must contain an subject and an action.

In the interface, we speak either on behalf of the team, or describing the actions of the service in the third person.

We don't ask users questions on information screens and make the affirmative conditional sentences. Reason for it – we're training users and there are no functional options to answer. It's just information, not iteration survey flow where the user can answer a question and choose yes or not.

If users need to answer – we’re asking questions.
