# Typography

For being confident with layouts at our design and creating a most likely a pixel-perfect prototypes we’re using a </b>4px grid system</b>.

We also should use a </b>12 columns system</b>. Each column has </b>width 82 px</b>, the space between columns is a </b>20 px</b>.

Minimum space between an image and text without a title is </b>21 px</b>. Minimum space between an image and text blocks with titles is </b>35px</b>.

All text should have a line-height </b>1.5x</b> it means that if your font size a 16pt your line height is 24pt.
