## Webshops
Some webshops can have their custom fonts. 
For example, for Winterswijk webshop uses Helvetica (MacOS), Arial (Windows), Verdana (MacOS & Windows)

In the perfect case, we should use only Montserrat for all our webshops. Webshops that prefer to save their brand identity such as Nijmegen can use their own fonts as a corporate identity element.
