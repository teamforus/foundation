# Figma files

## 🖼️ Cover
The goal of the cover is that Figma displays files as a grid of thumbnail images that show first page of the file. This means that sometimes — even if you know the correct file name, you might struggle to find the right file.

#### Contents
- Name of the IP (should be the same as the one on Github)
- A link to Github issue and github issue number 
- Status -> what phase is it in (define, design, deploy)
- owner of file

## 🟢 Master
The goal of the master page is to clearly communicate the source of truth of this specific feature or project at the time of implementation to everyone in the organisation.

#### Contents
- Screens and any relevant specifications. Screen should only be included here if they are 100% ready for development.

## 🔍 Review
The goal of a review page is to share and let others check out your work. Its effectively a staging environment for designs. Owner of file will move pages from review to master

#### Content
- Sticky note explaining the change which been made. Should be clear what needs to be reviewed.
- Screens and relevant specifications. 
- owner of this page

## ⚽ Play
A page which is not ready for review. Could include a random idea; its an explorative mess, whatever the designer(s) needs to realize their creative vision.

### Contents
- This page can contain wireframes and mockups which can be made ready to be reviewed.

## 🗄️ Archived
The goal of archive pages is to perserve ideas, decisions about designs which might otherwise not have remained in memory

#### Content
- The screens of master/review pages from any past iteration. A good practice is to merge alot of archived pages. (To not clutter the file)
