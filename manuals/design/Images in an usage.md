## Images we use

All images should be in a good quality. First tip is to upload an image in a **2x size**. 
Please remember to create an image in a 2x size. For example if you want to upload an image with a frame size 1200\*800 you should prepare an image with a size 2400\*1600

The main goal is to find theÂ balance between the lowest file size and an acceptable quality. You use a medium compression (high quality) photo on our websites.
Some tools can help with good quality compression: https://tinyjpg.com/ https://tinypng.com/ 

We should also suggest to our users to upload images in high quality.
