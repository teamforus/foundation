# Typography style-guides

For being confident with layouts at our design and creating a most likely a pixel-perfect prototypes weâ€™re using a **4px grid system**.

Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns. We also should use a **12 columns system**. For the webshops the width of content is **1200px**. Each column has width **82px**, the space between columns is a **20px**.

Minimum space between an image and text without a title is **21px**. Minimum space between an image and text blocks with titles is **35px**.

All text should have a **line-height 1.5**, it means that if your font size a 16pt your line height is 24pt.

# Measurement from the baseline

Specify distances from UI elements from the baseline. They worked with a grid. Please follow these rules to create more accurate design and implementations across all platforms.
