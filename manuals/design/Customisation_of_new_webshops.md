# Customisation of new webshops.

## The first steps for the customization should include:
– Request for a brand book or any other components of the municipality's corporate identity

– Defining the corporate colors of the municipality

– Defining the corporate font of the municipality that is being customized

Then we defining which styling we need to update and apply.

## Main steps and areas of customization that we need to pay attention:
– To change all fonts into our Figma prototypes

– Look at the colors and styles, change it properly according to the general prototypes and mmunicipality branding

– Don’t use more two colors (one is primary for all immportant commponents include call to action buttons and etc. and second is additional)

– Look at the corners of shapes and buttons. Use the same roundness for all components

– Use the common page grid and column system for all prototypes. (https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/master/manuals/design/typography-styleguides.md)

– Make a page width for prototypes the same (usually we’re using 1440px)

– Try to avoid using too much Bold text for designs.

– Use a different text blocks for a different text styles in your designs.

– - Pay attention to the page size. Please, remember that usually height of screens is around 600px
