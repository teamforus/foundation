# Improvement proposal

An improvement proposal helps to ensure the quality, usefulness and efficient implementation of an improvement. 

Depending on the topics in the improvement proposal, it can be made in two ways: 
* In a public issue with the proposal and discussion in the issue
* In a public issue with the proposal and discussion in a (public or private) google document

##  What makes a good improvement proposal?
A good improvement proposal clearly describes the:

* Current situation
* Desired situation
* Plan

The goal of the improvement proposal is to itterate on these three points until the plan is clear and can be approved for implementation. The comment area on the issue and/or in the google doc can be used to discuss proposals and options.

### Current situation
Clearly explain the current situation in order to facilitate an effective discussion and enable optimal decision making. This can start simple but if during discussions it becomes clear that the understanding of the current situation is not good enough, this explanation should be improved. If there is a visual change, adding screenshots can help.

### Desired situation
Clearly discribe the desired situation, some resources can help with this:

* User stories
* If impacting design: a figma improvement proposal
* Design / UX requirements
* Technical requirements
* Acceptance criteria

### Plan
Explain the plan of how to get from the current situation to the desired situation.

Considerations:

* Resources
* Communication / stakeholders
* Team capacity
* Funding
* Timeline

## Turning an improvement proposal into an [epic](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-epic.md)

The goal of a improvement proposal is to come up with a clear plan. 

When this succeeds and the improvement proposal is accepted for implementation, it is time to create an [epic](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-epic.md). 

### How to turn an improvement proposal into an [epic](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-epic.md).
The [epic](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-epic.md) should be created in the general repository, while the tasks should be created in the Forus and Me repositories. The links to the tasks should be added to the [epic](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-epic.md).
