# Epic

When it is clear and approved what needs to be built, it is time to create an epic.

## What makes a good epic?

An epic is mainly a collection of tasks. The epic issue can contain information about the goal of the epic, and supporting materials like user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria and figma prototypes.

### High fidelity figma prototype

If there are visual changes, there should be a high fidelity figma protype. The content in the prototype should be final.

### Clearly defined tasks
The [tasks](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-task.md) should be added to the appropriate repositories, for example [Forus]() and [Me]().

### Estimations

### Assigning tasks
