## Purpose of this manual.

Forus and Me are complex products with a growing user base. Making improvements while maintaining and increasing quality is challenging. This manual serves to clearly define a process that is followed and that can be iterated on. This helps with managing expectations and improving how value can be added to the products effectively.

## Issues:

Most changes start with an issue. There are a few different kinds of issues. Each type has a certain level of clearity that is needed to continue to the next stage. If you're not sure what kind of issue to open, you can always open a change request.

## Where to open the issue.

If you're not sure where to open an issue, you can _generally_ open it in "**general**" (no pun intended). 

There are a few scenario's where an issue should be opened somewhere else:

- This is a critical issue that needs to be solved ASAP and / or this issue contains sensitive data: Your issue might be an incident. Open the issue in the ITSM repository if you can access it or send an email to support@forus.io
- This is a clearly defined bug or task that is easy to fix: please open it directly in the product repository (Forus or Me)
