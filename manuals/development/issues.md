# Manual: Issues

## Purpose of this manual.

This manual explains what types of issues there are, when and where to open different kind of issues, and how an issue can advance to the next stage and finally be closed.

### Where to open the issue
In most cases issues can be [opened in the general repository](https://github.com/teamforus/general/issues/new/choose). If you're not sure what type of issue to open, you can always open a [change request](https://github.com/teamforus/general/blob/develop/manuals/development/issue-change-request.md).

There are a few scenario's where an issue should be opened somewhere else:

- This is a critical issue that needs to be solved ASAP and / or this issue contains sensitive data: Your issue might be an incident. Open the issue in the ITSM repository if you can access it or send an email to support@forus.io
- This is a clearly defined bug or task that is easy to fix: please open it directly in the product repository ([Forus](https://github.com/teamforus/forus/issues) or [Me](https://github.com/teamforus/me/issues))
