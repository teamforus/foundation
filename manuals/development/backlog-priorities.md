# Backlog priorities:

# Initial priority: MoSCoW labels
The first level of indexing the priority of an issue is by using MoSCoW rules. This is done directly while creating the issue or before moving it to the backlog. The label is also meant to inspire discussion, new insigts might lead to changing the label. Don‚Äôt be afraid to assign a label. If people disagree, it can be discussed.

## Must have
It needs to be done, no matter what. For example because it‚Äôs a hard, agreed upon, commitment in an (internal) project. Or because it needs to be done to avoid incidents or reputation/trust damage.

*Must have issues should be fixed as urgently as possible. üöÄ*

## Should have
(Highly) desirable improvements. For example improving the user experience. Should have issues propose significant improvements, helping to match and exceed expectations.

*There should be no surprises, except for delight. üòä*

## Could have
It‚Äôs not certain that there will be a highly positive impact, but it might still be good to do.

## Won't have
Is not desirable or feasible at this time. This often means the issue will be closed or iceboxed.

# Prioritising within the (zenhub) backlog.
After using the labels to assign an priority, a more refined priority will be specified by placing the issue in the backlog. 

## Finding the right place on the backlog
The higher on the backlog the issue is, the more important it is. When in doubt, put it at the bottom of the ‚Äúmoscow‚Äù group in the backlog. Ask yourself if it‚Äôs more important than the issue above it; if the answer is yes, move it up one place. Keep doing this until the issue above it is more important then your new issue.

## Priority desision making
Some questions might help you make a desision about priority within a one tier of the moscow priorities. For example; two issues are both ‚Äúshould-have‚Äù - which one is more important than the other? 

### üóë Does this remove or simplify broken or unused functionality?

Functionality that is currently built but that is not used or understood should probably be removed. 2 checks should be done: is there a risk for current users if this is removed (support) or are there plans to implement this functionality (implementation? then this functionally can not be removed or a better plan needs to be made. If both departments agree with the removal. It is most desirable. Less is more.

### üßπ Does this improve existing functionality? 

If there is functionality that is currently being used but where this issue can improve this functionality for existing users, this is a very desirable change.

### ‚ú® Does this introduce useful new functionality?

Introducting new functionality should only be done if it is certain that this will be useful for existing users. It should be done carefully in order to make sure that this does not increase complexity, but instead creates a simpler, more powerful, elegant and useful product for our users.
