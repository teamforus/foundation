# Welcome to the foundation-direction wiki!

The information you find here is the contemporary result of the process of establishing our organisational VMOSA and policies. After establishing presentable drafts these wiki's will be placed in the foundation-organisation repository. Once there we will finalize them together. So for now you can see these texts as draft versions that still need general approval.


### VMOSAR

We have established our VMOSAR to conceptualize our common values, desires and to way to materialize. This is a collective effort to which all can contribute.

### The establishment of our VMOSAR

This is a joint effort and to give this effort some structure we have policies on it. You can read them here to see how you can contribute.

### New policies

Our policy on creating policies is as follows.

During our directional meetings we will discuss incoming pieces. Once the board agrees we will implement the changes to our wiki's
