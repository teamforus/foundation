## Phase 3: Optional: Wireframe 
<< brainstorm session results in a photo of a whiteboard, picture of a drawing on paper >>

<< R ask C for feedback or to join brainstorm session; R asks A to approve wireframe; R informs I of wireframe if done; >>

<< design new elements if needed >>
<< ask designer to look at new template >>

<< R ask C for feedback; R asks A to approve template; R informs I of wireframe if done; >>

## Phase 5: Prototype
<< Use templates to create a prototype (definition: high fidelity representation of the final product which is meant to simulate user interaction) in figma >>

<< R ask C for feedback on prototype; R asks A to approve wireframe; R informs I of wireframe if done; >>



## Phase 6: Development
Goal: Convert the prototype into code and add changes into the design library.
